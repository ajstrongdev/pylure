# PyLure

*A simple, intuitive and easy to use Python text editor*

</div>

* PyLure is still in it's early stages of development, more features are being added. See the roadmap below.

PyLure is built ontop of TkInter, meaning it is a truly cross-platform native application which will work on any desktop operating system.

## Installation

**Ubuntu:**

* Build from source:

Dependencies (apt & pip):

`apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-tk idle3`

`pip install tkterminal`

* On Ubuntu 23.04 and higher you need to run `pip install tkterminal --break-system-packages` to have it install correctly.

```
git clone https://github.com/ajstrongdev/pylure.git
cd pylure/installers
bash ubuntu-install.sh
```
